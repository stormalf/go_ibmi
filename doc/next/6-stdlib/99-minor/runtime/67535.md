The [AddCleanup] function attaches a function to a pointer. Once the object that
the pointer points to is no longer reachable, the runtime will call the function.
[AddCleanup] is a finalization mechanism similar to [SetFinalizer]. Unlike
[SetFinalizer], it does not resurrect objects while running the cleanup. Multiple
cleanups can be attached to a single object. [AddCleanup] is an improvement over
[SetFinalizer].
