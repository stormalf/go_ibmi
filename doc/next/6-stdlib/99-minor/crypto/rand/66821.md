The [Read] function, and the `Read` method of [Reader], are now
defined to never fail.
They will always return `nil` as the `error` result.
If something somehow goes wrong while reading random numbers,
the program will irrecoverably crash.
This change was made because all supported systems now provide
sources of random bytes that never fail.
