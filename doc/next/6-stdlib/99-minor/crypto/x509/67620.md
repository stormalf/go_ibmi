The default certificate policies field has changed from
[Certificate.PolicyIdentifiers] to [Certificate.Policies]. When parsing
certificates, both fields will be populated, but when creating certificates
policies will now be taken from the [Certificate.Policies] field instead of the
[Certificate.PolicyIdentifiers field]. This change can be reverted by setting
`GODEBUG=x509usepolicies=0`.
