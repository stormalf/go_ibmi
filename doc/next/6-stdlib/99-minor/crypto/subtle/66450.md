The [WithDataIndependentTiming] function allows the user to run a function with
architecture specific features enabled which guarantee specific instructions are
data value timing invariant. This can be used to make sure that code designed to
run in constant time is not optimized by CPU-level features such that it
operates in variable time. Currently, [WithDataIndependentTiming] uses the
PSTATE.DIT bit on arm64, and is a no-op on all other architectures.
