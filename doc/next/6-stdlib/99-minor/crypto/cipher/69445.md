[NewOFB], [NewCFBEncrypter], and [NewCFBDecrypter] are now deprecated. OFB and
CFB mode are not authenticated, which generally enables active attacks to
manipulate and recover the plaintext. It is recommended that applications use
[AEAD] modes instead. If an unauthenticated [Stream] mode is required, use
[NewCTR] instead.
